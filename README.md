# Data-Mining-Project
*This project helps us to understand the concepts on supervised and unspervised learning.*

# Problem-1 - Bank customer segmentation:
**A leading bank wants to develop a customer segmentation to give promotional offers to its customers. They collected a sample that summarizes the activities of users during the past few months. You are given the task to identify the segments based on credit card usage.**

This problem statement help us to understand the concept of unsupervised learning technique:
1. Heirarchical clustering - Agglomerative clustering
    - Dendogram: Useful graphical representation of clustering process and results.
2. Partitioning clustering - K-means clustering.
    - Model validation - To find out the optimum number of K-value.
        - Silhouette plot
        - Elbow plot | WSS plot | Distortion plot 

# Problem-2 - Insurance Claim prediction:
**An Insurance firm providing tour insurance is facing higher claim frequency. The management decides to collect data from the past few years. You are assigned the task to make a model which predicts the claim status and provide recommendations to management. Use CART, RF & ANN and compare the models' performances in train and test sets.**

This problem statement help us to understand the concept of supervised learning technique:
1. CART - Classification and Regression Technique 
2. Random Forest - Ensemble Learning Technique
3. ANN - Artificial Neural Networks.
4. Model Evaluation - Various performance metrics have been used to validate the performance of predictions on Test & Train sets.
    a. Model Accuracy
    b. Classification Report
    c. Confusion matrix.
    d. ROC curve
